## ðŸš€ Installation

Note: You should use the F-Droid or GitHub version of Termux instead of the one on the Google Play Store. The Play Store version is often outdated, buggy, lacks functionality, and has previously been a source of security regressions and even a malicious, hijacked app. In contrast, F-Droid and GitHub versions are actively maintained, more stable, and generally considered safer.

### From F-Droid (Recommended)
Download the F-Droid app from [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org).


### From GitHub APK
Visit the [Termux GitHub Releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).
