## 🟠 Introduction

Termux is a powerful terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android. It allows you to run a wide range of Linux packages, programming languages, and network tools directly on your device. With Termux, you can learn, experiment, and automate tasks while on the go.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Full Linux environment on Android
- Supports `apt`, `pkg`, and other package managers
- Pre-installed programming tools: Python, Node.js, Git, and more
- SSH client/server, scripting, automation
- Customizable and lightweight
- Offline usage after initial setup

---

## 🚀 Installation

Note: You should use the F-Droid or GitHub version of Termux instead of the one on the Google Play Store. The Play Store version is often outdated, buggy, lacks functionality, and has previously been a source of security regressions and even a malicious, hijacked app. In contrast, F-Droid and GitHub versions are actively maintained, more stable, and generally considered safer.

### From F-Droid (Recommended)
1. Download the F-Droid app from [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org).
2. Watch this tutorial for installation: [Vidoe](https://youtu.be/V1-zzo-tCyI)

### From GitHub APK
1. Visit the [Termux GitHub Releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).
2. Download the APK and install it manually.

⚙ Required permissions: Storage access, internet connection for package installation.
